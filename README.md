# The Kathleen Dating Adventure

Let $\varphi$ be a real integer such that $x \in \mathbb{R^2}$, which represents the time spent on each date. We then let $f(\varphi)$ be the number of dates that Kathleen has participated in.

From this, we calculate the horniness factor, $\bowtie$, which is defined as

$$
\bowtie = \int_{a}^{b} f(\varphi) \, \text{d} \, \varphi
$$

where $a, b \in \mathbb{R^2}$ represent the limits of time spend for each date.
